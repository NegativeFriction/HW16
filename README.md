React Google Books

React Google books serves as a means to create a (shared) repository of saved books. Users can search for a book by title on the search page. They will then receive a list of possible matches from google users may save these to their lists for later. If a user wishes to remove a book from their list, they may open up their saved page and click "delete book" for the book in question.
